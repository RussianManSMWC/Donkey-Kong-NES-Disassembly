This is a disassembly of Donkey Kong for the NES and it's different revisions - Rev 0 (Japenese), Rev 1 (International) and Gamecube. It's fully disassembled but it's not fully documented. 

Doesn't include graphics data. You must rip it yourself (or use a python script in "misc" folder). Assembles with "asm6" assembler.
