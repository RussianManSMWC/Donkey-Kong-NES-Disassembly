Labels follow this format:

VERSION_TAG/NAME_ADDRESS

Tags:
CODE - marks a block of code
DATA - marks a block of data
UNUSED - marks an unused code or data
LOOP - marks a repeating instructions
RETURN - marks a return from routine

there are also version-specific labels. Default labels refer to Revision 1/US version.
JP - revision 0/japan only 
Gamecube - gamecube only

There's no consistency in referring to revision 0 and 1. Sometimes i call them JP and US. Not sure which is correct. I might change it later.
Also, I refer to player character who would become the world's most famous plumber as Jumpman, just for authencity. All references to Jumpman can be referred to Mario.
