Labels follow this format:

VERSION_TAG/NAME_ADDRESS
(example: JP_LOOP_C000)

Tags:
CODE - marks a block of code
DATA - marks a block of data
UNUSED - marks an unused code or data
LOOP - marks a set of instructions that are executed multiple times (in a loop)
RETURN - marks a return from routine

there are also version-specific labels. Default labels refer to Revision 1/US version (yeah, their adresses aren't the same for others. can't really do much, add PC address for each line for each version? would've been cool with automated tool)
JP - revision 0/japan only 
Gamecube - gamecube only

There's no consistency in referring to revision 0 and 1. Sometimes i call them JP and US. Not sure which is correct. I might change it later.
Also, I refer to player character who would become the world's most famous plumber as Jumpman, just for authencity. All references to Jumpman can be replaced with references to Mario.

Terminology:
Sprite Tiles - OAM tiles
Sprite - an object, usually uses sprite tiles (donkey kong himself isn't a sprite for example, since he uses background tiles (exception: ending cutscene where he turns into a sprite when falling down))
Square (sound) - Pulse wave (some documentations call it square, some pulse wave, but I already used former)
